# Deprecated

This package is now deprecated. This package started by emulating functionality from Quantlib, but the [Quantlib.jl](https://github.com/pazzo83/QuantLib.jl) package now contains a much larger port of Quantlib. Some of the longer terms goals of this package are now implemented in [Miletus](http://juliacomputing.com/products/juliafin/miletus.html), a contract definition and modelling language from Julia Computing. 

## Ito, an open source toolkit for financial computing in Julia

Ito is a collection of Julia modules containing algorithms for efficient quantitative finance. 
It includes functions and frameworks for holiday calendars, day count conventions, term structures, 
stochastic processes and more. 

A lot of the functionality is work in progress, but there are hopefully some useful bits already. 

Detailed documentation is available at http://aviks.github.com/Ito.jl/

## Installation

```julia
Pkg.add("Ito")
```
